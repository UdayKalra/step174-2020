              <p>“I tell ya, it’s because they’re so kissy kissy,” I overhear a woman pontificate to her friend. Her companion,
                  dressed in a similar, yet not identical pair of purple leggings, nods in knowing agreement. “Those Itaaalians,”
                  continues the first woman. “They have just such a…such a… what’s the word? Kissy kissy society.”
                  <br><br>
                  “I know!” responds the second. “Even guys kiss each other when they see other guys.” 
                  <br><br>
                  The first woman’s rather large dog begins pawing at the second woman’s rather small dog. The women, 
                  who walk six feet apart from each other, ignore it. “That’s why it’s not gonna get that bad in America. 
                  We aren’t as… kissy kissy.”
                  <br><br>
                  Worried they’ll notice that I’ve slowed to listen in, I pick up my pace and continue on my run. 
                  <br><br>
                  April days like these were always my favorite growing up — sixty-eight degrees, sunny, cherry-blossoms beginning
                  to bloom. An avid runner, I’ve always taken advantage of them — by now, I’ve jogged nearly every side-walk in this
                  sleepy New Jersey suburb. I’m not used to the company. Throughout my five-mile route, I dip and dive in an attempt
                  to stay socially distanced from the small clusters of walkers that pepper the sidewalks. Running paths that usually
                  lie untrodden now suffer from hesitant traffic jams as walkers, bikers, and joggers attempt to squeeze through
                  narrow straightaways, silently maneuvering around each other as if surrounded by invisible force fields.
                  <br><br>
                  I pass family after family after family on group bike rides — the type of collective exercise usually reserved
                  for only the most exemplar of suburban households. You know the type of family I’m talking about — they also eat 
                  gluten-free dinners.

                  I had already read and re-read it four times; the pages of my paperback copy were characteristically dog-eared and tea-stained. But this time, something was different. This time, as I lost myself once again to the spell of Amor Towles’ historical fiction masterpiece, A Gentleman in Moscow, I felt suddenly raw, dissected, exposed. I felt as if I was staring into a mirror — my own life blinked innocently back at me, as if it had been there all along, waiting.
                  <br><br>
                  A Gentleman in Moscow follows Count Aleksander Rostov, who is deemed a threat by a Bolshevik tribunal in 1922 and sentenced to house arrest in Moscow’s Metropol Hotel. Unable to leave the Metropol for the remainder of his life, the Count must rediscover his own purpose during one of the most tumultuous eras in Russian history.
                  <br><br>
                  If its setting were changed to America in the year 2020, the novel couldn’t cut closer to home — many of us have never known uncertainties more disruptive and daunting than the coronavirus pandemic. But A Gentleman in Moscow is more than just a reflection of our lives: it is a manual for how to survive them. With its laugh-out-loud wit, charm, and incisive explorations of resilience, love, and hope, it provides us with a path through the darkness, a path we might be able to follow, one step at a time, to whatever light waits for us beyond.

                  In moments of personal and political desperation, all we can hope for is escape, change, or movement — anything to disappear. And yet leaving a past life behind is unendingly complicated. The interpersonal mess that results from migration is the subject of Mohsin Hamid’s Exit West, where characters cross miles in moments, crawling out of door-like portals into foreign lands as if “dying and being born” at once. Hamid probes these metaphorical deaths and births, painting a precise emotional portrait of the limbo that is migration.
                  <br><br> 
                  Through his system of portals, Hamid limits discussion of the journey of migration and turns our attention to the personal effects of leaving home. At the center of his tale of transitions are Nadia and Saeed, lovers meeting secretly in an unnamed city. Nadia’s conservative dress conceals her liberalism, ardent feminism, and drug use. She and Saeed, a more devout Muslim who works in advertising, develop a romance that burgeons as their city languishes under military occupation. Hamid contrasts Nadia’s outward piety and inward rebelliousness with Saeed’s growing faith, noting how their unlikely bond is made all the more romantic by the perilous conditions in which it takes place. As day-to-day life in their city becomes near impossible, Nadia and Saeed decide to risk leaving all they know behind by crossing a portal westward.
                  <br><br>
                  From here on, Exit West becomes another novel, not a war-time romance featuring a charmingly relatable couple, but a futuristic portrait of the tragedies and serendipities of migratory life. With fairy-tale like prose, Hamid employs fantastical and lyrical modes to capture the aftershocks of migration. He writes with linguistic ambiguity, a halting syntax that mirrors Nadia and Saeed’s liminality: “Every time a couple moves, they begin, if their attention is still drawn to one another, to see each other differently, for personalities are not a single immutable color, like white or blue, but rather illuminated screens, and the shades we reflect depend much on what is around us.” Both migration and love, we learn, are capricious; the love you expect to be your sustenance might unravel with the uncertainties of life in transit.

                  Too many mosquitoes. I fan the folded trail map in front of my face to break up the gathering swarm. To keep the insects at bay, I continue waving the paper up and down for the next quarter mile or so. My right arm gets tired, so I switch to my left.
                  <br><br>
                  I pause for a sip of water. We have just passed through a tunnel of rhododendrons, two parallel lines of bushy branches reaching up in a natural arc. It is not yet July, so there are no blushes of bright pink flowers — only dark green leaves broken with patches of white sun.
                  <br><br>
                  I hear the faint buzzing return, like a constant ringing in the ears; you can’t stay still for too long. My mom stops next to me and slaps her cheek. Guess how many this time? I guess two, perhaps three. Her hand comes away with a smattering of gray mosquito bodies and blood. Macy hardly seems bothered, and even in the humidity I envy her lush fur coat.
                  <br><br>
                  We began the day driving south on Walpack Road, the recommended route to Buttermilk Falls according to the park’s website. It was not, however, the most direct, and by the time we turned off the main thoroughfare to the small side road leading to the Falls, I was already feeling carsick. It was our first hiking trip in New Jersey, at the end of my freshman year. Unlike the carefully blazed trails of the Shenandoah we had trekked in the past, Jersey trails were less well maintained, and trail markings often stopped abruptly, leaving us stranded with little choice but to go back the way we came. Both of us wondered what we would encounter on this hike.
